// Question #3: Compressing Strings
// Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

// Example
// Input: "aaabccdddda"

// Output: "3ab2c4da"

// Non-recursive:
// Use reduce to compress string
